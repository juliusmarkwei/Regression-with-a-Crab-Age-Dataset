## Crab Age Prediction Machine Learning Competition

Welcome to the Crab Age Prediction Machine Learning Competition repository! This project aims to predict the age of crabs using advanced machine learning techniques. The competition provides an exciting opportunity to explore crab biology and develop accurate age prediction models.
Description

Crabs are fascinating creatures with intricate growth patterns. Accurately determining their age plays a vital role in understanding their life cycle, population dynamics, and ecological impact. The goal of this competition is to develop robust machine learning models that can predict the age of crabs based on various biological features and measurements.

This repository contains the code, datasets, and resources related to the competition. Participants are encouraged to explore the data, experiment with different models and algorithms, and contribute their insights to advance the field of crab age prediction.
